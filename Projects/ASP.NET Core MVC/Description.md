# Description

**ASP.NET MVC** is a design pattern used to archive the separations of concerns. With MVC(_model-view-controller_) you can easily decouple user-interface (_view_), data (_model_), and application logic (_controller_).

As data storage, you will use an SQL database and Entity Framework will be used to interact with your data. You will also learn how to update database schema using Entity Framework migrations, how to add data to the database, get data from the database, update data in the database and also delete data from the database.

You will learn about creating services to work with your data, but also create generic services/repositories to help you implement commonly used tasks like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from the database.

Other important features include dynamic content rendering with ViewComponenets, Paypal payments integration role-based UI rendering.
