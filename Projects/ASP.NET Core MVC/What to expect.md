# WHAT TO EXPECT?

-   **What is MVC?**

    -   A `Model` is just _a C# class_ that represents a table in the SQL Server. So it basically serves as a _data blueprint_ and can also be used to define the _data relations_.
    -   A `view`, as the name already indicates, is what the user gets to see. So it is a file that represents the _user interface_, and an MVC view is a _CSHTML file_ where CS stands for C sharp and HTML for the HTML code. You can trigger the request or the events that get handled by the controllers.
    -   A `Controller` will _receive the events_, then we'll prepare a response and then just _return the response to the view_. A controller is just a c sharp class that inherits from the controller base class.
